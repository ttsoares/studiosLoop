## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use two different typefaces configured via TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

The layout.js approach of NextJS impose some complications as the one in this page where the background image
in the Home must algo be below the Nav... My intuition is that there is a better way to solve it.

### Useful resources

- NextJS 14 - [Course from CodeEvolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjAqacIC_3c&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjOKd6gdf4QtV1uYNiQnruI)
